<!-- <aside><p>The persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany was a priority of the Nazi police state. Before 1933, homosexual acts were illegal in Germany but a thriving gay culture existed. Nazi persecution of homosexuals peaked prior to World War II. Between 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men were arrested. Those arrested were presumed guilty, and subjected to harsh interrogation and torture to elicit a confession. Their death rate has been estimated at 60 percent, a higher rate than other prisoner groups. Nazi Germany's persecution of homosexuals is considered to be the most severe episode in a long history of discrimination and violence targeting sexual minorities. After the war, homosexuals were initially not counted as victims of Nazism because homosexuality continued to be illegal in Nazi Germany's successor states. Few survivors came forward to discuss their experiences. This changed during the gay liberation movement of the 1970s, and the pink triangle was reappropriated as an LGBT symbol. (Full article...)

    Hope II
    Hope II is a oil-on-canvas painting with added gold and platinum by the Austrian symbolist artist Gustav Klimt, created in 1907–1908. It depicts a pregnant woman with closed eyes, with a human skull representing death appearing from behind her stomach – perhaps a sign of the dangers of labour. At the foot of the painting, three other women bow their heads, as if praying or mourning. The square painting measures 110.5 centimetres (43.5 in) on each side, and is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
